## WPILib Mission

The WPILib Mission is to enable FIRST teams to focus on writing game-specific software rather than on hardware details - "raise the floor, don't lower the ceiling". We try to enable teams with limited programming knowledge and/or mentor experience to do as much as possible, while not hampering the abilities of teams with more advanced programming capabilities. We support Kit of Parts control system components directly in the library. We also strive to keep parity between major features of each language (Java, C++, and NI's LabVIEW), so that teams aren't at a disadvantage for choosing a specific programming language. WPILib is an open-source project, licensed under the BSD 3-clause license. You can find a copy of the license [here](license.txt).

# Building Eclipse Plugins

Building the Eclipse Plugins is very straightforward. The plugins use Gradle to compile, which calls into Maven under the hood.

## Requirements
- [JDK 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)
- Maven

## Building

To actually build the plugins, simply call:

```bash
./gradlew build
```

To clean, call:

```bash
./gradlew clean
```

Note that there will be a lot of output. This is because Gradle is actually calling into Maven under the hood.

## Modifying the NI Image Version

The Gradle harness takes care of deduplicating the NI allowable image versions by copying [`ni_image.properties`](ni_image.properties) to `edu.wpi.first.wpilib.plugins.java/src/main/resources/java-zip/ant/` and to `edu.wpi.first.wpilib.plugins.cpp/src/main/resources/cpp-zip/ant/`. To update the version, simply change the `ni_image.properties` in the repository root and the changes will be copied during the next build.

## Dependencies from other Parts of WPILib

The build pulls in a specific set of dependencies, which can be updated at any time by running the `updateDependencies` task. This task will also be run during official builds, or when this is the first build (ie, the repo has just been cloned). When developing on other parts of WPILib and building the plugins to test, make sure to run the `updateDependencies` task, or it will not pull in the new version that you will have published to `~/releases/development`. Do **not** submit the changed pom.xml files in a pull request: this can mess with the build system and cause PR test failures as well as official build failures. The only time the updated pom should be checked in is when incrementing the version number of either the plugins itself, or a released dependency is being updated (in which case, the version number also likely should be updated).

The dependency update plugin has a quiet period for checking each repo for updates. This means that it won't necessarily see an update to the global FRC repo, even if a version is published there that is newer than the version in the `~/.m2` cache. This update period has been disabled for the local FRC repository, `~/releases/`, in the main [pom.xml](pom.xml). If you're attempting to get a version of a dependency that was published to http://first.wpi.edu/FRC/roborio/maven/ and it's not showing up, this is likely the reason. There are a couple of solutions: delete the artifact you need to update from the `~/.m2` cache, or change the update policy for the `FRC Binaries` repository in the main [pom.xml](pom.xml) to match the `Local Repo`.

Since having to specify `updateDependencies` at every build will get tedious if constantly rebuilding the plugins, you can put the words `always generate` in the `generated_version` file that the build generates in the root of the repository. When that text is in the file, the version will always be updated on every build.
