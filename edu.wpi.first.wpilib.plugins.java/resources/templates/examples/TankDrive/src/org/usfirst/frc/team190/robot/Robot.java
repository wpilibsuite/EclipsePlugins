/**
 * This is a demo program showing the use of the RobotDrive class, specifically
 * it contains the code necessary to operate a robot with tank drive.
 *
 * The VM is configured to automatically run this class, and to call the
 * functions corresponding to each mode, as described in the SampleRobot
 * documentation. If you change the name of this class or the package after
 * creating this project, you must also update the manifest file in the resource
 * directory.
 *
 * WARNING: While it may look like a good choice to use for your code if you're
 * inexperienced, don't. Unless you know what you are doing, complex code will
 * be much more difficult under this system. Use IterativeRobot or Command-Based
 * instead if you're new.
